= Vendor Prefixes and Extensions Policies

== Policy for vendor prefix allocation
The Toolchain Conventions document lists
xref:src/toolchain-conventions.adoc#vendor-prefixes-list[the canonical RISC-V vendor prefixes]
used in open-source projects to prevent naming collisions, especially in
open-source toolchains. It is not meant to be an official registry but rather a
central place for discussing and recording vendor prefix conventions.

Open-source project maintainers may make pull requests against this repository
to request the allocation of a vendor prefix.

The early allocation of vendor prefixes is recognized as a measure to prevent
conflicts in downstream implementations during extension specification
refinement. Although presenting the vendor extension specification is not
mandatory when requesting a vendor prefix, doing so demonstrates good faith and
intent to refine and open-source the vendor extension specification.

The Toolchain SIG reserves the right to reclaim a vendor prefix if there is
evidence of misuse or insufficient upstreaming activity. This ensures that prefix
allocation remains efficient and avoids unnecessary congestion.

== Policy for vendor extension inclusion
The Toolchain Conventions document includes
xref:src/toolchain-conventions.adoc#vendor-extensions-list[a list of RISC-V vendor extensions]
used in open-source projects, including open-source toolchains.
It serves as an informative reference for the latest documentation on
extensions supported by vendors.

Open-source project maintainers can request the inclusion of a vendor extension
by making a pull request against this repository.

For inclusion in this list, the vendor must provide a link to the documentation
that details the extension name, version number, instructions list, CSRs, and
other components, along with their descriptions and functionalities. Although
extension specifications may change over time, maintaining an updated
specification is essential for open-source development.

There are no prerequisites for implementing the vendor extensions on hardware,
toolchain, or simulator.
