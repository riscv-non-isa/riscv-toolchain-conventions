== Specifying the target ISA with -march

The compiler and assembler both accept the `-march` flag to specify the target
ISA, e.g. `rv32imafd`. The abbreviation `g` can be used to represent either
`IMAFD` (when targeting RISC-V ISA specification version 2.2 or earlier) or
`IMAFD_Zicsr_Zifencei` (version 20190608 or later) base and extensions,
e.g. `-march=rv64g`. A target `-march` which includes floating point
instructions implies a hardfloat calling convention, but can be overridden
using the `-mabi` flag (see the next section).

The ISA subset naming conventions and canonical order are described in
Chapter `ISA Extension Naming Conventions` of the RISC-V user-level ISA
specification. However, tools do not currently follow this specification
(input is case sensitive, ...).

The rule of ISA string become more complicated, due to extension implication
rules and more extensions added into RISC-V, the canonical order is non-obvious
to humans, so tools should accept the ISA string in non-canonical order to reduce
the burden of remembering the canonical order.

Detailed rules for ISA string:

. First letter must be `i`, `e` or `g`.
. Single-letter may be non-canonical order.
. Multi-letter may be non-canonical order.
. Multi-letter must be separated by underscore.
. Version separator(`p`) has higher priority than `p` extension.

Example:
[source, asm]
----
rv32ima_zicsr        # Valid ISA string.
rv32i_zicsr_m        # Valid ISA string.
rv32i_zicsr_ma       # Valid ISA string.
rv32imac             # Valid ISA string.
rv32mai              # Invalid ISA string, first letter must be `i`, `e` or `g`.
rv32i_zicsrzifence   # Valid ISA string, but it will interpreted as rv32
                     # with base extension and `zicsrzifence` extension
                     # rather than `zicsr` and `zifence` extensions.
rv32i2p1             # Valid ISA string, it recognized as `I` extension with
                     # version 2.1 rather than `I` extension with with version
                     # 2.0 and `P` extension with 1.0.
----

If the 'C' (compressed) instruction set extension is targeted, the compiler
will generate compressed instructions where possible.

NOTE: Single-letter extension with version (e.g. `m2p0`) is still treated as
a single-letter extension, it won't be treated as a multi-letter extension.

NOTE: Any output of ISA string like `Tag_RISCV_arch` must be canonical order.

NOTE: Cross-tool argument are highly recommended to be passed in canonical order
for backward compatibility.

=== Issues for consideration
- Whether `riscv32` and `riscv64` should be accepted as synonyms for `rv32`
and `rv64`.
- Whether the `-march` string should be parsed case insensitively.
- Exposing the ability to specify version numbers for a target extension.
- Specifying non-standard extensions. The ISA specification suggests naming
such as `rv32gXfirstext_Xsecondext`. In GCC or Clang it would be more
conventional to give a string such as `rv32g+firstext+secondext`.

== Specifying the target ABI with -mabi

- https://github.com/riscv-non-isa/riscv-elf-psabi-doc/blob/master/riscv-cc.adoc#abi-ilp32[`ilp32`]:
  int, long, pointers are 32-bit. GPRs and the stack are used for
  parameter passing.
- https://github.com/riscv-non-isa/riscv-elf-psabi-doc/blob/master/riscv-cc.adoc#abi-ilp32f[`ilp32f`]:
  int, long, pointers are 32-bit. GPRs, 32-bit FPRs, and the stack are
  used for parameter passing.
- https://github.com/riscv-non-isa/riscv-elf-psabi-doc/blob/master/riscv-cc.adoc#abi-ilp32d[`ilp32d`]:
  int, long, pointers are 32-bit. GPRs, 64-bit FPRs and the stack are
  used for parameter passing.
- https://github.com/riscv-non-isa/riscv-elf-psabi-doc/blob/master/riscv-cc.adoc#abi-lp64[`lp64`]:
  long, pointers are 64-bit. GPRs and the the stack are used for
  parameter passing.
- https://github.com/riscv-non-isa/riscv-elf-psabi-doc/blob/master/riscv-cc.adoc#abi-lp64f[`lp64f`]:
  long, pointers are 64-bit. GPRs, 32-bit FPRs, and the stack are used for
  parameter passing.
- https://github.com/riscv-non-isa/riscv-elf-psabi-doc/blob/master/riscv-cc.adoc#abi-lp64d[`lp64d`]:
  long, pointers are 64-bit. GPRs, 64-bit FPRs, and the stack are used for
  parameter passing.

See the https://github.com/riscv-non-isa/riscv-elf-psabi-doc/blob/master/riscv-cc.adoc[RISC-V ELF psABI]
for more information on these ABIs.

The default value for `-mabi` is system dependent. For cross-compilation, both
`-march` and `-mabi` should be specified. An error will be produced for
impossible combinations of `-march` and `-mabi` such as `-march=rv32i` and
`-mabi=ilp32f`.

=== Issues for consideration

- Should the `-mabi` string be parsed case insensitively?
- How should the RV32E ABI be specified? `ilp32e`?

== Specifying the target code model with -mcmodel

The target code model indicates constraints on symbols which the compiler can
exploit these constraints to generate more efficient code. Three code models are
currently defined for RISC-V:

- `-mcmodel=medlow`. The program and its statically defined symbols must lie
within a single 2GiB address range, between the absolute addresses -2GiB and
+2GiB. `lui` and `addi` pairs are used to generate addresses.
- `-mcmodel=medany`. The program and its statically defined symbols must lie
within a single 4GiB address range. `auipc` and `addi` pairs are used to
generate addresses.
- Use of any PIC or PIE option (e.g. -fpic, -fPIC, -fpie or -fPIE) will enable
the medium position independent code model. This model is similar to the medium
any code model, but uses the global offset table (GOT) for non-local symbol
addresses.

NOTE: When PIC or PIE mode enabled the `-mcmodel=medlow` will be suppressed.

RISC-V psABI has a contain sections to describe the code model:

- https://github.com/riscv-non-isa/riscv-elf-psabi-doc/blob/master/riscv-elf.adoc#medium-low-code-model[Medium low code model]: -mcmodel=medlow
- https://github.com/riscv-non-isa/riscv-elf-psabi-doc/blob/master/riscv-elf.adoc#medium-low-code-model[Medium any code model]: -mcmodel=medany
- https://github.com/riscv-non-isa/riscv-elf-psabi-doc/blob/master/riscv-elf.adoc#medium-position-independent-code-model[Medium position independent code model]:  -fpic, -fPIC, -fpie or -fPIE.

== Disassembler (objdump) behaviour

A RISC-V ELF binary is not currently self-describing, in the sense that it
doesn't contain enough information to determine which variant of the RISC-V
architecture is being targeted. GNU objdump will currently attempt disassemble
any instruction whose encoding matches one of the standard RV32/RV64GC
extensions.

objdump will default to showing pseudoinstructions and ABI register names. The
`numeric` disassembler argument can be used to use architectural register
names such as `x10`, while the `no-aliases` disassembler argument will ensure
only canonical instructions rather than pseudoinstructions or aliases are
printed. These arguments are specified using `-M`, e.g. `-M numeric` or `-M
numeric,no-aliases`.

Perhaps surprisingly, the disassembler will default to hiding the difference
between compressed (16-bit) instructions and their 32-bit equivalent. e.g.
`c.addi sp, -16` will be printed as `addi sp, sp, -16`.

=== Issues for consideration

- The current GNU objdump behaviour will not provide useful results for cases
where non-standard extensions are implemented which reuse some of the standard
extension's encoding space. Making RISC-V ELF files self-describing (as
discussed https://github.com/riscv-non-isa/riscv-elf-psabi-doc/pull/47[here])
would avoid this problem.
- Would it be useful to have separate flags that control the printing of
pseudoinstructions and whether compressed instructions are printed directly or
not?

== Assembler behaviour

See the https://github.com/riscv-non-isa/riscv-asm-manual/blob/master/riscv-asm.md[RISC-V Assembly Programmer's Manual]
for details on the syntax accepted by the assembler.

The assembler will produce compressed instructions whenever possible if the
targeted RISC-V variant includes support for the 'C' compressed instruction
set.

=== Issues for consideration
* There is currently no way to enable support for the 'C' ISA extension, but to
disable the automatic 'compression' of instructions.

== C/C++ preprocessor definitions

- `+__riscv+`: defined for any RISC-V target. Older versions of the GCC
toolchain defined `+__riscv__+`.
- `+__riscv_xlen+`: 32 for RV32 and 64 for RV64.
- `+__riscv_float_abi_soft+`, `+__riscv_float_abi_single+`,
`+__riscv_float_abi_double+`: one of these three will be defined, depending on
target ABI.
- `+__riscv_cmodel_medlow+`, `+__riscv_cmodel_medany+`: one of these two will be
defined, depending on the target code model.
- `+__riscv_mul+`: defined when targeting the 'M' ISA extension.
- `+__riscv_muldiv+`: defined when targeting the 'M' ISA extension and
`-mno-div` has not been used.
- `+__riscv_div+`: defined when targeting the 'M' ISA extension and `-mno-div`
has not been used.
- `+__riscv_atomic+`: defined when targeting the 'A' ISA extension.
- `+__riscv_flen+`: 32 when targeting the 'F' ISA extension (but not 'D') and 64
when targeting 'FD'.
- `+__riscv_fdiv+`: defined when targeting the 'F' or 'D' ISA extensions and
`-mno-fdiv` has not been used.
- `+__riscv_fsqrt+`: defined when targeting the 'F' or 'D' ISA extensions and
`-mno-fdiv` has not been used.
- `+__riscv_compressed+`: defined when targeting the 'C' ISA extension.

=== Issues for consideration
- What should the naming convention be for defines that indicate support for
non-standard extensions?
- What additional information could/should be exposed via preprocessor
defines?

== Specifying stack alignment

The default stack alignment is 16 bytes in RV32I and RV64I, and 4 bytes on
RV32E. There is not currently a way to specify an alternative stack alignment,
but the `-mpreferred-stack-boundary` and `-mincoming-stack-boundary` flags
supported by GCC on X86 could be adopted.

== Save restore support

The save restore optimization is enabled through the option `-msave-restore`
and reduces the amount of code in the prologue and epilogue by using
library functions instead of inline code to save and restore callee saved
registers. The library functions are provided in the emulation library and
have the following signatures:

- `void` `+__riscv_save_<N>(void)+`
- `void` `+__riscv_restore_<N>(void)+`
- `void` `+__riscv_restore_tailcall_<N>+` `(void * tail /* passed in t1 */)` (LLVM/compiler-rt only)

`<N>` is a value between 0 and 12 and corresponds to the number of
registers between `s0` and `s11` that are saved/restored. The return
address register `ra` is always included in the registers saved and restored.

The `+__riscv_save_<N>+` functions are called from the prologue, using `t0` as
the link register to avoid clobbering `ra`. They allocate stack space for the
registers and then save `ra` and the appropriate number of registers from
`s0`-`s11`. The `+__riscv_restore_<N>+` functions are tail-called from the
epilogue. They restore the saved registers, deallocate the stack space for the
register, and then perform a return through the restored value of `ra`.

`+__riscv_restore_tailcall_<N>+` are additional entry points used when the
epilogue of the called function ends in a tail-call. Unlike
`+__riscv_restore_<N>+` these are also provided the address of the function
which was originally tail-called as an argument, and after restoring
registers they make a tail-call through that argument instead of returning.
Note that the address of the function to tail-call is provided in register `t1`,
which differs from the normal calling convention.

As of November 2021 the additional tail-call entry points are only
implemented in compiler-rt, and calls will only be generated by LLVM
when the option `-mllvm -save-restore-tailcall` is specified.

== Conventions for vendor extensions

Support for custom instruction set extensions are an important part of RISC-V,
with large encoding spaces reserved of vendor extensions.

However, there are no official guidelines on naming the mnemonics. This section
defines guidelines which vendors are expected to follow if upstreaming support
for their extensions. Although vendor-provided toolchains are free to make
different choices, they are strongly urged to align with these guidelines in
order to ensure there is a straightforward path for upstreaming in the future.

NOTE: Open source toolchain maintainer has final say on accepting vendor
extension, comply with this conventions isn't guarantee upstream will accept.

=== Vendor extension naming scheme

According to the RISC-V ISA spec, non-standard extensions are named using a single `X`
followed by an alphabetical name and an optional version number.

To make it easier to identify and prevent naming conflict, vendor extensions
should start with a vendor name, which could be an abbreviation of the full name.

For example:

- `XVentanaCondOps` from Ventana
- `Xsfcflushdlone` from SiFive

=== Assembly mnemonic

In order to avoid confusion between standard extension and other vendor
extensions, instruction mnemonics from vendor extensions must have a
prefix corresponding to the vendor's name.

The vendor prefix should be at least two letters long

e.g. `sf.` for SiFive, `vt.` for Ventana. No central registration with RISC-V
International or elsewhere is required before the prefix is used.

NOTE: Although no centralized registration is required, vendors should add the
vendor prefix to the table _IF_ vendors are interested to upstream their
extension to open source toolchain like LLVM or GNU toolchain.

Vendors should also aim to follow the conventions used for naming mnemonics
in the ratified base ISA and extensions (e.g. the use of 'w', 'd',
'u', and 's' suffixes).

=== CSR naming scheme

Vendors may define their own CSRs within the custom read-only CSR address range
specified in the RISC-V ISA spec. However, to avoid conflicts, each vendor CSR
must include a prefix corresponding to the vendor's name.

The vendor prefix should match the prefix defined in assembly mnemonics and be
separated by a dot, e.g., `th.vxrm`.

== Common Toolchain Command Line Options

This section lists common RISC-V specific toolchain command line options.

=== `-mstrict-align`/`-mno-strict-align`
Indicates that the compiler should not assume that unaligned scalar and
unaligned vector memory references are handled by the system.


`-mstrict-align`: The compiler disallows misaligned memory access.

`-mno-strict-align`: The compiler allows misaligned memory access.

The compiler's behavior will follow this order of precedence:

- Use the setting from `-mstrict-align` / `-mno-strict-align` if either option
is given, taking the last one specified.
- Use the setting from `-mtune` if `-mstrict-align` / `-mno-strict-align` is not given.
- Use the setting from `-mcpu` if neither of the above options is given.
- Use the compiler's default setting if none of the above options are provided.

NOTE: Non-strict also known as unaligned access or misaligned access

NOTE: The compiler may generate misaligned access if the program violates the
      alignment assumption.

NOTE: This option does not affect inline assembly.

=== `-mscalar-strict-align`/`-mno-scalar-strict-align`/`-mvector-strict-align`/`-mno-vector-strict-align`

`-mscalar-strict-align`/`-mno-scalar-strict-align`: Similar to
`-mstrict-align`/`-mno-strict-align` but applied to scalar memory access only.

`-mvector-strict-align`/`-mno-vector-strict-align`: Similar to
`-mstrict-align`/`-mno-strict-align` but applied to vector memory access only.

The precedence among `-m[no]-scalar-strict-align`, `-m[no-]vector-strict-align`,
and `-m[no-]strict-align` is determined by the last one specified.
