== Target Triplets

The following architecture names are used for RISC-V in the first segment of
target triplets:

- `riscv32` RV32, little-endian
- `riscv32be` RV32, big-endian
- `riscv64` RV64, little-endian
- `riscv64be` RV64, big-endian

For example, `riscv32-unknown-none-elf` denotes 32-bit RISC-V, little-endian,
from an unknown vendor, for no operating system (baremetal), following the ELF
ABI.

== Specifying the target ISA with -march

The compiler and assembler both accept the `-march` flag to specify the target
ISA, e.g. `rv32imafd`. The abbreviation `g` can be used to represent either
`IMAFD` (when targeting RISC-V ISA specification version 2.2 or earlier) or
`IMAFD_Zicsr_Zifencei` (version 20190608 or later) base and extensions,
e.g. `-march=rv64g`. A target `-march` which includes floating point
instructions implies a hardfloat calling convention, but can be overridden
using the `-mabi` flag (see the next section).

In addition to regular ISA strings, `-march=` also accepts `unset`, whose
behavior is: `-march=unset` causes the compiler to ignore any `-march=...`
options that appear earlier on the command line, behaving as if the option was
never passed. This is useful for ensuring that the architecture is taken from
the `-mcpu` option, and it will result in an error if no `-mcpu` option
is given when `-march=unset` is used.

Examples:

[source, shell]
----
# Basic usage: ignores earlier -march and uses -mcpu
gcc -march=rv64i -march=unset -mcpu=sifive-x280 file.c
# Result: Uses architecture from sifive-x280 CPU definition

# Multiple -march options before unset are all ignored
gcc -march=rv64g -march=rv32i -march=unset -mcpu=sifive-x280 file.c
# Result: Uses architecture from sifive-x280 CPU definition

# -march after unset takes precedence
gcc -march=rv64i -march=unset -mcpu=sifive-x280 -march=rv64g file.c
# Result: Uses rv64g (later -march overrides unset behavior)

# Multiple unset operations
gcc -march=rv64i -march=unset -mcpu=sifive-x280 -march=rv32i -march=unset file.c
# Result: Uses architecture from sifive-x280 CPU definition

----

NOTE: If `-mcpu` is not provided when using `-march=unset`, the compiler may
      generate an error.

NOTE: `-march=unset` is only supported by newer toolchian (e.g. GCC 16+, clang/LLVM 22+).

The ISA subset naming conventions and canonical order are described in
Chapter `ISA Extension Naming Conventions` of the RISC-V user-level ISA
specification. However, tools do not currently follow this specification
(input is case sensitive, ...).

The rule of ISA string become more complicated, due to extension implication
rules and more extensions added into RISC-V, the canonical order is non-obvious
to humans, so tools should accept the ISA string in non-canonical order to reduce
the burden of remembering the canonical order.

Detailed rules for ISA string:

. First letter must be `i`, `e` or `g`.
. Single-letter may be non-canonical order.
. Multi-letter may be non-canonical order.
. Multi-letter must be separated by underscore.
. Version separator(`p`) has higher priority than `p` extension.

Example:
[source, asm]
----
rv32ima_zicsr        # Valid ISA string.
rv32i_zicsr_m        # Valid ISA string.
rv32i_zicsr_ma       # Valid ISA string.
rv32imac             # Valid ISA string.
rv32mai              # Invalid ISA string, first letter must be `i`, `e` or `g`.
rv32i_zicsrzifence   # Valid ISA string, but it will interpreted as rv32
                     # with base extension and `zicsrzifence` extension
                     # rather than `zicsr` and `zifence` extensions.
rv32i2p1             # Valid ISA string, it recognized as `I` extension with
                     # version 2.1 rather than `I` extension with with version
                     # 2.0 and `P` extension with 1.0.
----

If the 'C' (compressed) instruction set extension is targeted, the compiler
will generate compressed instructions where possible.

NOTE: Single-letter extension with version (e.g. `m2p0`) is still treated as
a single-letter extension, it won't be treated as a multi-letter extension.

NOTE: Any output of ISA string like `Tag_RISCV_arch` must be canonical order.

NOTE: Cross-tool argument are highly recommended to be passed in canonical order
for backward compatibility.

=== Issues for consideration
- Whether `riscv32` and `riscv64` should be accepted as synonyms for `rv32`
and `rv64`.
- Whether the `-march` string should be parsed case insensitively.
- Exposing the ability to specify version numbers for a target extension.
- Specifying non-standard extensions. The ISA specification suggests naming
such as `rv32gXfirstext_Xsecondext`. In GCC or Clang it would be more
conventional to give a string such as `rv32g+firstext+secondext`.

== Specifying the target profile with -march

Similar to the target ISA, the `-march` flag can be used to set the target
profile. A RISC-V profile is a ratified set of extensions with a unique name.

The `-march` flag accepts the following form when specifying a target profile:
  `"-march="<profile-name>["_"option-ext]*`

`profile-name ::= 'profile-name-in-lowercase'`

`option-ext ::= 'a legal RISC-V extension name'`

For a list of valid RISC-V profile names refer to the
https://github.com/riscv/riscv-profiles[RISC-V profile specification],
which also discusses the naming convention.

To distinguish between the target ISA and the target profile base formats
for the `-march` flag, profiles need to be placed at the beginning of
the string, and may be followed by additional extensions.
This means that the string provided to the `-march` flag begins either
with a ISA base or a profile.

Examples:

`-march=rvi20u64` equals `-march=rv64i`

`-march=rvi20u64_zbkb_zkne` equals `-march=rv64i_zbkb_zkne`

`-march=rva22u64` equals `-march=rv64gcb_zic64b_zicbom_zicbop_zicboz_ziccamoa_ziccif_zicclsm_ziccrse_zicntr_zihpm_za64rs_zfhmin_zkt`

== Specifying the target CPU with -mcpu

The `-mcpu=<name>[+[no]<extension>+...]` option uses the architecture of and optimizes the output for the given RISC-V processor.

- The target RISC-V architecture (as if specified by `-march`)
- The RISC-V processor type for which to tune for performance (as if specified by `-mtune`)

Note that `-mcpu` does not override `-march` or `-mtune`.

Many RISC-V processors implement optional architectural extensions. By default,
all supported extensions for the specified CPU are enabled. However, if implementations
that lack certain extensions exist, the extension syntax can be used to disable
those extensions that have been omitted.

=== Extension control syntax

The extension control syntax follows the ARM convention:

- `+extension`: Enables the extension if it is disabled by default. Has no effect if the extension is already enabled by default.
- `+noextension`: Disables the extension if it is enabled by default. Has no effect if the extension is already disabled by default.

Use `+extension` or `+noextension` to explicitly enable or disable an optional RISC-V extension.
You can specify one or more extensions that a processor supports.

Common extension control options include:

- `+nof`: Disables single-precision floating-point instructions (F extension) and any extensions that depend on it, such as the D extension (double-precision floating-point)
- `+nod`: Disables double-precision floating-point instructions (D extension)
- `+nov`: Disables vector instructions (V extension)
- `+noc`: Disables compressed instruction support (C extension)
- `+nozicsr`: Disables Zicsr extension
- `+nozifencei`: Disables Zifencei extension
- `+v+zvl256b`: Enables vector instructions (V extension) with 256-bit vector length (Zvl256b extension)

The `-mcpu` option supports enabling or disabling any valid RISC-V extension using the `+extension` or `+noextension` syntax. The examples above illustrate commonly used extensions, but the mechanism applies to all standard and vendor-specific RISC-V extensions.

When specifying conflicting extension modifiers with `-mcpu`, the rightmost extension is used.
For example, the following command enables single-precision floating-point instructions:
`gcc -mcpu=xt-c908+nof+f file.c`

=== Examples

[source, shell]
----
# Basic usage: specify target CPU
gcc -mcpu=xt-c908 file.c

# Disable single-precision floating-point (F extension)
# Note: D extension (double-precision) is also disabled due to F dependency
gcc -mcpu=xt-c908+nof file.c

# Enable vector extension and Zvfh (half-precision vector float)
# This configuration is equivalent to xt-c908v
gcc -mcpu=xt-c908+v+zvfh file.c

# Conflicting modifiers: rightmost takes precedence
# Single-precision floating-point is enabled despite +nof
gcc -mcpu=xt-c908+nof+f file.c

# Multiple -mcpu options: last one takes precedence
# This is equivalent to using only -mcpu=xt-c908+v+zvfh
gcc -mcpu=xt-c910 -mcpu=xt-c908 -mcpu=xt-c908+v+zvfh file.c

----

== Specifying the target ABI with -mabi

- https://github.com/riscv-non-isa/riscv-elf-psabi-doc/blob/master/riscv-cc.adoc#abi-ilp32[`ilp32`]:
  int, long, pointers are 32-bit. GPRs and the stack are used for
  parameter passing.
- https://github.com/riscv-non-isa/riscv-elf-psabi-doc/blob/master/riscv-cc.adoc#abi-ilp32f[`ilp32f`]:
  int, long, pointers are 32-bit. GPRs, 32-bit FPRs, and the stack are
  used for parameter passing.
- https://github.com/riscv-non-isa/riscv-elf-psabi-doc/blob/master/riscv-cc.adoc#abi-ilp32d[`ilp32d`]:
  int, long, pointers are 32-bit. GPRs, 64-bit FPRs and the stack are
  used for parameter passing.
- https://github.com/riscv-non-isa/riscv-elf-psabi-doc/blob/master/riscv-cc.adoc#abi-lp64[`lp64`]:
  long, pointers are 64-bit. GPRs and the the stack are used for
  parameter passing.
- https://github.com/riscv-non-isa/riscv-elf-psabi-doc/blob/master/riscv-cc.adoc#abi-lp64f[`lp64f`]:
  long, pointers are 64-bit. GPRs, 32-bit FPRs, and the stack are used for
  parameter passing.
- https://github.com/riscv-non-isa/riscv-elf-psabi-doc/blob/master/riscv-cc.adoc#abi-lp64d[`lp64d`]:
  long, pointers are 64-bit. GPRs, 64-bit FPRs, and the stack are used for
  parameter passing.

See the https://github.com/riscv-non-isa/riscv-elf-psabi-doc/blob/master/riscv-cc.adoc[RISC-V ELF psABI]
for more information on these ABIs.

The default value for `-mabi` is system dependent. For cross-compilation, both
`-march` and `-mabi` should be specified. An error will be produced for
impossible combinations of `-march` and `-mabi` such as `-march=rv32i` and
`-mabi=ilp32f`.

=== Issues for consideration

- Should the `-mabi` string be parsed case insensitively?
- How should the RV32E ABI be specified? `ilp32e`?

== Specifying the target code model with -mcmodel

The target code model indicates constraints on symbols which the compiler can
exploit these constraints to generate more efficient code. Three code models are
currently defined for RISC-V:

- `-mcmodel=medlow`. The program and its statically defined symbols must lie
within a single 2GiB address range, between the absolute addresses -2GiB and
+2GiB. `lui` and `addi` pairs are used to generate addresses.
- `-mcmodel=medany`. The program and its statically defined symbols must lie
within a single 4GiB address range. `auipc` and `addi` pairs are used to
generate addresses.
- `-mcmodel=large`. The program and its statically defined symbols can lie
within the whole 64-bit address range. `auipc`, `addi` and `ld` are used to
generate addresses.
- Use of any PIC or PIE option (e.g. -fpic, -fPIC, -fpie or -fPIE) will enable
the medium position independent code model. This model is similar to the medium
any code model, but uses the global offset table (GOT) for non-local symbol
addresses.

NOTE: When PIC or PIE mode enabled the `-mcmodel=medlow` will be suppressed.

RISC-V psABI has a contain sections to describe the code model:

- https://github.com/riscv-non-isa/riscv-elf-psabi-doc/blob/master/riscv-elf.adoc#medium-low-code-model[Medium low code model]: -mcmodel=medlow
- https://github.com/riscv-non-isa/riscv-elf-psabi-doc/blob/master/riscv-elf.adoc#medium-any-code-model[Medium any code model]: -mcmodel=medany
- https://github.com/riscv-non-isa/riscv-elf-psabi-doc/blob/master/riscv-elf.adoc#large-code-model[Large code model]: -mcmodel=large
- https://github.com/riscv-non-isa/riscv-elf-psabi-doc/blob/master/riscv-elf.adoc#medium-position-independent-code-model[Medium position independent code model]:  -fpic, -fPIC, -fpie or -fPIE.

== Disassembler (objdump) behaviour

A RISC-V ELF binary is not currently self-describing, in the sense that it
doesn't contain enough information to determine which variant of the RISC-V
architecture is being targeted. GNU objdump will currently attempt disassemble
any instruction whose encoding matches one of the standard RV32/RV64GC
extensions.

objdump will default to showing pseudoinstructions and ABI register names. The
`numeric` disassembler argument can be used to use architectural register
names such as `x10`, while the `no-aliases` disassembler argument will ensure
only canonical instructions rather than pseudoinstructions or aliases are
printed. These arguments are specified using `-M`, e.g. `-M numeric` or `-M
numeric,no-aliases`.

Perhaps surprisingly, the disassembler will default to hiding the difference
between compressed (16-bit) instructions and their 32-bit equivalent. e.g.
`c.addi sp, -16` will be printed as `addi sp, sp, -16`.

=== Issues for consideration

- The current GNU objdump behaviour will not provide useful results for cases
where non-standard extensions are implemented which reuse some of the standard
extension's encoding space. Making RISC-V ELF files self-describing (as
discussed https://github.com/riscv-non-isa/riscv-elf-psabi-doc/pull/47[here])
would avoid this problem.
- Would it be useful to have separate flags that control the printing of
pseudoinstructions and whether compressed instructions are printed directly or
not?

== Assembler behaviour

See the https://github.com/riscv-non-isa/riscv-asm-manual/blob/master/riscv-asm.md[RISC-V Assembly Programmer's Manual]
for details on the syntax accepted by the assembler.

The assembler will produce compressed instructions whenever possible if the
targeted RISC-V variant includes support for the 'C' compressed instruction
set.

=== Issues for consideration
* There is currently no way to enable support for the 'C' ISA extension, but to
disable the automatic 'compression' of instructions.

== C/C++ preprocessor definitions

These are now maintained in the
https://github.com/riscv-non-isa/riscv-c-api-doc/blob/main/src/c-api.adoc[RISC-V
C API specification].

== Specifying stack alignment

The default stack alignment is 16 bytes in RV32I and RV64I, and 4 bytes on
RV32E. There is not currently a way to specify an alternative stack alignment,
but the `-mpreferred-stack-boundary` and `-mincoming-stack-boundary` flags
supported by GCC on X86 could be adopted.

== Save restore support

The save restore optimization is enabled through the option `-msave-restore`
and reduces the amount of code in the prologue and epilogue by using
library functions instead of inline code to save and restore callee saved
registers. The library functions are provided in the emulation library and
have the following signatures:

- `void` `+__riscv_save_<N>(void)+`
- `void` `+__riscv_restore_<N>(void)+`
- `void` `+__riscv_restore_tailcall_<N>+` `(void * tail /* passed in t1 */)` (LLVM/compiler-rt only)

`<N>` is a value between 0 and 12 and corresponds to the number of registers
between `s0` and `s11` that are saved/restored. When using the `ILP32E` ABI,
`<N>` can be at most 2, as `s3` to `s12` are temporary registers in this ABI.

The return address register `ra` is always included in the registers saved and
restored.

The `+__riscv_save_<N>+` functions are called from the prologue, using `t0` as
the link register to avoid clobbering `ra`. They allocate stack space for the
registers and then save `ra` and the appropriate number of registers from
`s0`-`s11`. The `+__riscv_restore_<N>+` functions are tail-called from the
epilogue. They restore the saved registers, deallocate the stack space for the
register, and then perform a return through the restored value of `ra`.

`+__riscv_restore_tailcall_<N>+` are additional entry points used when the
epilogue of the called function ends in a tail-call. Unlike
`+__riscv_restore_<N>+` these are also provided the address of the function
which was originally tail-called as an argument, and after restoring
registers they make a tail-call through that argument instead of returning.
Note that the address of the function to tail-call is provided in register `t1`,
which differs from the normal calling convention.

As of November 2021 the additional tail-call entry points are only
implemented in compiler-rt, and calls will only be generated by LLVM
when the option `-mllvm -save-restore-tailcall` is specified.

=== Save Restore Routine Stack Frame Layouts

While the implementation of the save restore routines are in the library, it is
the compiler's responsibility to emit the unwind information (CFI) for the
registers that are saved and restored by these routines, so the compilers and
the libraries must agree on the stack layouts used by these routines.

As the stack pointer must be correctly aligned at all times, the save restore
routines are expected to allocate more stack than they require to spill all
registers in many cases. Additional Callee-saved registers, beyond those
requested, may be saved and restored by these routines, in line with the
existing practice of saving and restoring registers in batches to match the
stack alignment (which saves on code size).

For the `LP64`, `LP64F`, `LP64D`, and `LP64Q` ABIs, the save restore routines
use `roundup(N+1, 2) * 8` bytes of stack space (where `roundup(val, multiple)`
rounds `value` up to a multiple of `multiple`).

For the `ILP32`, `ILP32F`, and `ILP32D` ABIs, the save restore routines use
`roundup(N+1, 4) * 4` bytes of stack space.

For the `ILP32E` ABI, the save restore routines use `(N+1) * 4` bytes of stack
space (which reflects the lower stack alignment used by this ABI).

In all the save restore routines, across all ABIs, `ra` is stored adjacent to
the incoming stack pointer (highest address), then the Callee-Saved registers in
register order from `s0` to `s11`. This follows the [Frame Pointer
Convention](https://github.com/riscv-non-isa/riscv-elf-psabi-doc/blob/master/riscv-cc.adoc#frame-pointer-convention),
whether or not a frame pointer is actually being used, and contradicts with the
order used by Zcmp push/pop instructions.

== Conventions for vendor extensions

Support for custom instruction set extensions are an important part of RISC-V,
with large encoding spaces reserved of vendor extensions.

However, there are no official guidelines on naming the mnemonics. This section
defines guidelines which vendors are expected to follow if upstreaming support
for their extensions. Although vendor-provided toolchains are free to make
different choices, they are strongly urged to align with these guidelines in
order to ensure there is a straightforward path for upstreaming in the future.

NOTE: Open source toolchain maintainer has final say on accepting vendor
extension, comply with this conventions isn't guarantee upstream will accept.

=== Vendor extension naming scheme

According to the RISC-V ISA spec, non-standard extensions are named using a single `X`
followed by an alphabetical name and an optional version number.

To make it easier to identify and prevent naming conflict, vendor extensions
should start with a vendor name, which could be an abbreviation of the full name.

For example:

- `XVentanaCondOps` from Ventana
- `Xsfcflushdlone` from SiFive

=== Assembly mnemonic

In order to avoid confusion between standard extension and other vendor
extensions, instruction mnemonics from vendor extensions must have a
prefix corresponding to the vendor's name.

The vendor prefix should be at least two letters long

e.g. `sf.` for SiFive, `vt.` for Ventana. No central registration with RISC-V
International or elsewhere is required before the prefix is used.

NOTE: Although no centralized registration is required, vendors should add the
vendor prefix to the table _IF_ vendors are interested to upstream their
extension to open source toolchain like LLVM or GNU toolchain.

Vendors should also aim to follow the conventions used for naming mnemonics
in the ratified base ISA and extensions (e.g. the use of 'w', 'd',
'u', and 's' suffixes).

=== CSR naming scheme

Vendors may define their own CSRs within the custom read-only CSR address range
specified in the RISC-V ISA spec. However, to avoid conflicts, each vendor CSR
must include a prefix corresponding to the vendor's name.

The vendor prefix should match the prefix defined in assembly mnemonics and be
separated by a dot, e.g., `th.vxrm`.

=== List of vendor prefixes
Please review
https://github.com/riscv-non-isa/riscv-toolchain-conventions/blob/main/vendor-policy.adoc#policy-for-vendor-prefix-allocation[the policy for allocating vendor prefixes]

== Common Toolchain Command Line Options

This section lists common RISC-V specific toolchain command line options.

=== `-mstrict-align`/`-mno-strict-align`
Indicates that the compiler should not assume that unaligned scalar and
unaligned vector memory references are handled by the system.


`-mstrict-align`: The compiler disallows misaligned memory access.

`-mno-strict-align`: The compiler allows misaligned memory access.

The compiler's behavior will follow this order of precedence:

- Use the setting from `-mstrict-align` / `-mno-strict-align` if either option
is given, taking the last one specified.
- Use the setting from `-mtune` if `-mstrict-align` / `-mno-strict-align` is not given.
- Use the setting from `-mcpu` if neither of the above options is given.
- Use the compiler's default setting if none of the above options are provided.

NOTE: Non-strict also known as unaligned access or misaligned access

NOTE: The compiler may generate misaligned access if the program violates the
      alignment assumption.

NOTE: This option does not affect inline assembly.

=== `-mscalar-strict-align`/`-mno-scalar-strict-align`/`-mvector-strict-align`/`-mno-vector-strict-align`

`-mscalar-strict-align`/`-mno-scalar-strict-align`: Similar to
`-mstrict-align`/`-mno-strict-align` but applied to scalar memory access only.

`-mvector-strict-align`/`-mno-vector-strict-align`: Similar to
`-mstrict-align`/`-mno-strict-align` but applied to vector memory access only.

The precedence among `-m[no]-scalar-strict-align`, `-m[no-]vector-strict-align`,
and `-m[no-]strict-align` is determined by the last one specified.

=== `-fcf-protection=[full|branch|return|none]`/`-fcf-protection`


Enable control flow protection. The compiler will insert control flow integrity
instructions to protect the program against control flow hijacking attacks.

`-fcf-protection` is alias to `-fcf-protection=full`.

- `none`: Disable control flow protection.
- `full`: Protects all control flow instructions. Branch protection does not
  require the `Zimop` extension, but return protection will be enabled only if
  `Zimop` is available.
- `branch`: Protect branch instructions only by inserting landing pad.
- `return`: Protect return instructions only, this require `Zimop` extension.

=== `-mcf-branch-label-scheme=[unlabeled|func-sig]`

Specify the label scheme for the `-fcf-protection=branch`. The default is value
is platform defined.

- `unlabeled`: Use simple label scheme, the label is always `0`.
- `func-sig`: Use function signature as the label, the label is generated by the
  compiler, the rule is defined in psABI spec.
